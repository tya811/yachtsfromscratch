metal hull yacht build.
hull specs:

all types of metal, but more cheap metal and less expensive metal, and then just place the more expensive metals sporatically throughout the hull, but symmetrically and balanced.
make the cost of all the metal, relatively equal, so 100 parts aluminum and maybe a few parts gold or platinum.

you can even make those panels rotate and turn them into engines by just opening and closing them either in succession unevenly from back to front, or doing 1 side than
the other side. 

you can use them for brakes and steering mechanisms by opening them to just create drag, and then you can have deployable foils too. 

and then you build a hull that the metal hull attaches too possibly at a distance of a few inches, and the inner hull should be rubber on the outside, (natural and synthetic)
and the rubber should over lay a hull that is laminate layers of recycled plastic, metal, wood, and foam of all sorts glued with idk like gorilla glue, epoxy, hemp cloth, 
kevlar and carbon fiber. 

and then if you run aground, all your possibly damaging is the metal exoskeleton of the boat. and maybe the metal things can extend or there can be a few things that extend and the
rest of the designs are similar to the other yachts.
